Okay so i have the arm. That uses shoulder angle to create the arm initially. 
Next it uses elbow and wrist x,y and z to form the position.
I added buttons to move wrist and elbow up and down in all 3 positions. To test for myself without the data.
If we get truple values we can honesly just input that for x,y and z from three sensor, for each time. 

we can see the arm in each time. Now the next task is how are we going to record each arm and make it like a video.
